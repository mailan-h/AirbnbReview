# About the project

> In this project, I analyzed listing and review data of properties listed on Airbnb using Python. The data covers listings in Asheville, North Carolina from 2011 to 2018.

# Data

> There are two raw datasets used in the project - listing dataset (\~5,200 listings) and review dataset (\~147,000 reviews).
>
> 1.  The listing dataset provides various information related to each listing such as location, property type, room type, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, price, as well as information about the host and cancellation policies.
>
> 2.  The review dataset provides information about the reviews associated with each listing, including reviewers and their sentiment scores calculated from sentiment analyses.
>
> The datasets are shared on this GitHub repository.

# Analyses

> My analyses consist of three parts:
>
> 1.  **Importing and understanding the datasets.** This step included importing the data and checking for missing values and duplicates.
>
> 2.  **Exploratory data analyses**. After combining the datasets, I analyzed reviews and sentiment scores by zipcode, year, season, host, and other factors. I also looked at pricing strategies on Airbnb and examined price variation by location, property type, and booking policies.
>
> 3.  **Regression analyses**. In this section, I ran multiple regression models to understand factors driving review sentiment. Besides the variables provided in the datasets, I added some additional variables to enrich the analyses (e.g., Ratio of baths/beds, Distance to Asheville city center calculated using longitude and latitude of each listing).
>
> For each section, I provided a summary of the key insights at the beginning and structured my notebook based on them for easy reference.
